**Remaining:** 1 (ErrorHandler.swift)

---

## Verification Steps

After adding ErrorHandler.swift:

1. **Build the project** (`Cmd+B`)
   - Should complete successfully
   - No compilation errors

2. **Check file references**
   - All 21 files should appear in Project Navigator
   - No red file names (missing references)
   - All files in appropriate groups/folders

3. **Run the app** (`Cmd+R`)
   - App launches successfully
   - No runtime errors
   - All features work as expected

## Notes

- All files already exist on disk in correct locations
- Don't use "Copy items if needed" - files are already in place
- Ensure "Create groups" (not "Create folder references")
- Verify "Zero" target is selected when adding files
- Build after adding to catch any issues early
